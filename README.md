When doing DevOps, you need a database !

  Database is for collecting, storing data and needs to be lightweight, very-fast and fun to work with !
     
        Sqlite3 meets my criteria, so, maybe it'll meet yours too :-D

Please refer to my Youtube-Title: Sqlitestudio# Build from Source on Win10, what you need  ( to be added and currently in progress ! )

If "Scottie's Way" gets you motivated to do more DevOps, then please support me and Subscribe to my Youtube-Channel

Kind Regards,
Scottie
